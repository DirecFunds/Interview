// In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each element is the sum of the two elements that precede it.
// Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn .
// Many writers begin the sequence with 0 and 1, although some authors start it from 1 and 1[1][2] and some (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.
//
//  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
//
// Please write a function that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence starting at 0, 1

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
